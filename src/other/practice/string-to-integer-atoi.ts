/*
 * Problem: String to Integer (atoi)
 *
 * Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).
 *
 * The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:
 *
 * 1. Read in and ignore any leading whitespace (`' '`).
 * 2. Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines the sign of the result. If the next character is neither `'-'` nor `'+'`, then no sign is assumed (positive).
 * 3. Read in next the characters until the first non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
 * 4. Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. "123" -> 123, "0032" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
 * 5. If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`, then clamp the number so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-2^31` should be clamped to `-2^31`, and integers greater than `2^31 - 1` should be clamped to `2^31 - 1`.
 * 6. Return the integer.
 *
 * Note:
 * - Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.
 * - Do not consider any other characters other than the digits and the sign character.
 * - Do not use any library functions that directly convert strings to integers, such as `int()`.
 * - The implementation should be based on the algorithm described above.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "42"
 * Output: 42
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "   -42"
 * Output: -42
 * Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign. Then take digits 42 (and 0 in front).
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: s = "4193 with words"
 * Output: 4193
 * Explanation: The first non-digit character is ' ', so the parsing stops.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 0 <= s.length <= 200
 * s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits ('0'-'9'), ' ', '+', '-', and '.'.

// You can add test cases here to verify your solution
// For example:
// console.log(myAtoi("42"));             // Expected: 42
// console.log(myAtoi("   -42"));          // Expected: -42
// console.log(myAtoi("4193 with words")); // Expected: 4193
// console.log(myAtoi("words and 987"));  // Expected: 0
// console.log(myAtoi("-91283472332"));   // Expected: -2147483648 (clamped)
// console.log(myAtoi("2147483647"));     // Expected: 2147483647
// console.log(myAtoi("-2147483648"));    // Expected: -2147483648
// console.log(myAtoi("0"));              // Expected: 0
// console.log(myAtoi("+1"));             // Expected: 1
// console.log(myAtoi("+-12"));           // Expected: 0
